## Execution
Each script is self-contained. To run the analysis for a specific question, ensure the dataset `exercise_2.dta` is in your working directory and run the corresponding script in Stata.

Run the following either in STATA or 
```stata
do <script_of_choice>.do
```

or directly from terminal
```stata
stata -b do <script_of_choice>.do
```

for instance,
```stata
stata -b do question_2.do
```
