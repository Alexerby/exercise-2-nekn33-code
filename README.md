# NEKN33 – Microeconometrics

## Institutional Quality and Growth (Acemoglu)

This repo contains Stata code for the NEKN33 Microeconometrics assignment on institutional quality and economic growth (Acemoglu et al.).

Each question is implemented as a **separate, self-contained `.do` file**.

---

## Files

* `exercise_2.dta`
  Dataset used by all scripts

* `question_X.do`
  Stata script for question *X*

* `results/`
  Output generated by the scripts (logs, figures, etc.)

You should not need to modify paths inside the `.do` files.

---

## How to run the code

Make sure `exercise_2.dta` is in the project root.

### From within Stata

Set the working directory to the project folder and run:

```stata
do question_X.do
```

---

### From the terminal (batch mode)

From the project root:

```bash
stata -b do question_X.do
```

For example:

```bash
stata -b do question_2.do
```

---

## Output

Each script:

* loads the dataset,
* runs the analysis for that question,
* saves figures and logs to a subfolder in `results/`.
